  I have no idea how and what should I put inside this story.txt file but I do know that I have to write a paragraph. So here we go.
  I just realized that I have a cup of boba tea staring at me.
  
  It was my favorite flavor, coconut milk tea with bubbles. I had gone to Kung Fu Tea earlier with my friend. On the way there, we saw a strange site. 
  In front of the university bookstore, there were elephants and giraffes. I couldn't believe my eyes! My friend and I wandered through, wondering why on earth
  there were these exotic animals randomly roaming State Street. Then, we looked down one of the side streets and finally understood why.
